        <h1>Joe Livingston</h1>
        <p> <strong>Alaska Neonatologist and developer</strong> </p>
        <p>I am a mid-career neonatologist practicing in the last frontier in Alaska's only level III NICU. Most of my immediate family live 4000 miles away, in Baltimore, Maryland. I enjoy biking and coding. I went to high school in Grand Junction,
          Colorado. Did a bachelor's degree in computer science and math at Mesa State College in my home town. I did a master's degree in computer science at the University of Oregon in Eugene, and then I went to medical school in Portland at Oregon
          Health Sciences University. I did a pediatric internship and residency at the University of Texas/Houston, practiced for about five years as a general pediatrician mostly on the island of Saipan, and then went back to do a fellowship in
          neonatology at the University of New Mexico. My first job out of fellowship was to be a junior faculty member in the department of pediatrics at the University of Arizona in Tucson. After five years I left to become a private neonatologist
          in Alaska. I'm married and have four children.</p>
